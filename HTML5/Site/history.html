    <h2 class="text0">History of Naberius</h2>

    <p class="text">
        The demon Naberius, first mentioned by Johann Weyer in, is supposedly the bravest Marquess of hell, with nineteen legions of demons at his command.<br>

He makes men shrewd in all the arts (and the sciences, according to most authors), but especially in rhetoric, speaking in a hoarse voice.<br> 
He also restores lost dignities and honours, although for Johann Weyer he acquires their loss.<br><br>

Naberius appears as a three-headed dog or a raven. He has a husky voice but presents himself in an expressive and cordial way. He teaches the art of living gracefully. He is portrayed as a raven or a black Gruidae.

It is associated with the image of the dog that protects a passage, and is directly linked<br> to the Greek mythological Cerberus, as well as Nibiru (an Akkadian term meaning "crossover" or "transition point").<br><br> 

It can be linked to the Norse mythological Garm, the Egyptian mythological god Anubis, the Aztec mythological god Xolotl, and the Hindu mythological Sharvara.

In his 1577 book, Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Weyer considers Cerberus and Naberius to be the same demon. He claims:

Naberus, alias Cerberus, Marchio est fortis, form corvi se ostentans: Si when loquitur, raucam edit vocem. Reddit & hominem amabilem & artium intelligentem, cum primis in Rhetoricis eximium. Pr√¶laturarum & dignitatum jacturam parit. Novendecim legiones hunc audiunt.

"Naberius, also known as Cerberus, is a brave marquis, and shows himself in the form of a raven: when he speaks, his voice is hoarse. lost. Nineteen legions listen (and obey)."

Other spellings: Cerberus, Cerbere, Kerberus, Naberus, Nebiros.
